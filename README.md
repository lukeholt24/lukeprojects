For now writing some stuff here to reflect what the video was saying. Will change this later as I make the actual website.

## Info

*This* is all in **markdown** which is a coding thing that turns it into HTML files.

Useful for:

- quick n easy stuff
- non specific stuff

I'm using some filler here clearly but I might forget stuff otherwise
